## T cells

> "When T cells initially detect an infected or cancerous cell, they 
multiply. Over a few days, a few hundred T cells can become many 
millions, expanding the small fraction of immune cells with just the 
right receptor to recognise the diseased cell. But an expansion of 
immune cells obviously cannot go on for ever and after a while, in 
the course of a normal immune response, T cells, and other immune cells,
must switch off so that the immune response winds down and the system 
returns to its normal resting state, usually after the threat has 
cleared." [The Beautiful Cure, p. 176]

> "Dendritic cells are particularly good at detecting germs. When they
do so, they signal to T cells that a germ is present---providing the 
second signal needed to kick-start an immune reaction---by displaying
so-called co-stimulatory proteins at their surface. These proteins
on the dendritic cells fit into receptor proteins on the surface of 
T cells like a key in a lock, essentially unlocking the T cell's 
potential." [The Beautiful Cure, p. 177]

> "The mysterious receptor had been given an especially cumbersome 
name: cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated molecule 4, or CTLA-4, 
named for simply being the fourth in a series of molecules identified
on T cells. ... [This receptor] was present at the surface of T cells
switched on to participate in an immune response---whereas is was
not present on T cells that were resting, simply waiting for signs
of trouble. This indicated that the molecule was somehow
important only once an immune response had got going. ... Blocking
CTLA-4 could boost an immune reaction, consistent with the idea that
CTLA-4 normally delivers a switch-off signal to T cells." [The Beautiful
Cure, pp. 178--180] 

> "We now know that after being switched on to participate in an 
immune response, all kinds of immune cells, including T cells, present
the PD-1 [programmed cell death 1] receptor proteins at their surface.
This receptor locks onto proteins on the surface of other cells that have 
been exposed to cytokines released as part of the immune response. Once
its PD-1 receptor protein is engaged in this way, a switch-off signal 
is triggered and the immune cell ceases its response. In this way, PD-1
is instrumental in stopping a reaction from being overly aggressive or 
going on for too long." [The Beautiful Cure, p. 185]

## Cytokines

> "Our immune cells bathe in a cacophony of cytokines---some switch the 
system on, others turn it off, many nudge its activity up or down a 
shade. Their purpose is to shape an immune response to fit the type of
problem, say a viral or bacterial infection, and connect the immune
system to other body systems. Their actions are incrediably complex---there
are cytokines that regulate the cytokines---but ... it is hard to overstate
their importance in how the body works or their potential for new 
medicines." [The Beautiful Cure, p. 73]

> "Cytokines are hormones in the sense that they are soluble factors
produced by one cell which then affect the behavior of other cells. 
Characteristics of some cytokines, however, are not usually attributed
to hormones: some cytokines act relatively locally in the body; for
example, a few are bound to the surface of cells rather than released
into the bulk liquid environment, and some cytokines can be produced
by many different types of cells." [The Beautiful Cure, p. 217]

## Interferon

> "Eventually, the existence of interferon opened the world's eyes
to a whole host of soluble proteins like it which are in the body for 
the same purpose: communication between cells and tissues and coordination
of the immune system. We now know that there are over a hundred different
proteins like interferon, some of which have been studied across thousands
of labs while others have been discovered only recently. Collectively they
are called cytokines; they are the immune system's hormones." [The Beautiful
Cure, p. 73]

> "When any cell's pattern-recognition receptor locks onto the telltale 
sign of a germ, this triggers the cell to start producing interferon. In
this way, almost any type of human cell can be induced to produce interferon
when, for example, it is infected with a virus. Interferon turns the infected
cell, and other cells nearby, into a defensive mode. It does this by switching
on a set of genes appropriately called the interferon-stimulated genes. 
These genes produce proteins which help stop bacteria and other germs, 
and are especially potent at dealing with viruses; they can block viruses 
from being able to enter nearby cells, stop viruses already in cells from 
getting into the nucleus of cells (where they need to go to replicate),
and prevent viruses from usurping the cell's machinery to make the proteins
needed for new copies of the virus." [The Beautiful Cure, p. 74]

> "One out of the ten genes taht make up the influenza virus---in other words, 
10% of all that it is---is devoted to counteracting the effects of interferon."
[The Beautiful Cure, p. 74]

> "There are many different types of interferon---at least seventeen---produced
by different cells in the body. Most of our cells can produce ... interferon
alpha to limit the spread of an intefection. ... Other forms of interferon 
are more specialized: interferon gamma, for example, is mainly produced by some 
types of white blood cell in order to amplify an ongoing immune response."
[The Beautiful Cure, pp. 76--77]

> "The genes switched on by each type of interferon are being catalogued
in an ever-expanding online database [Interferome]." [The Beautiful Cure, 
p. 77]

## Interleukin

> "Many of the other cytokines, discovered after interferon, are called
interleukins, so named for being the proteins that act *between* (inter-)
leukocytes, a formal name for white blood cells. Abbreviated to IL, each
type of interleukin is assigned a number, IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, and so on, 
currently up to IL-37. Like interferon, some of these leukocytes
come in slightly different versions (IL-1 has an alpha and beta form, for
example), and some differently numbered cytokines have features in common, 
so that there is an IL-1 family which include IL-18 and IL-33, for example."
[The Beautiful Cure, p. 77]

> "One of the cytokines which turn off immune system responses is IL-10. 
Discovered in 1989, isolated in 1990 and studied by thousands of scientists
since, we now know that this cytokine helps protect the body against unwanted
immune reactions. IL-10 curbs inflammation when an infection has been eliminated
and signals for the body's healing process, the repair of damaged tissues, to
begin." [The Beautiful Cure, p. 78]

## TNF

Tumour necrosis factor alpha

> "TNF has been identified in 1975 as a factor released from immune cells that
was able to turn tumours black and dead. This immediately led to great interest
in the cytokine in the hope that the tumour-killer could be used to treat cancer
patients, a hope that was dashed when it became clear that the cytokine itself
is quite toxic to the body even at doses to weak to be able to impact a tumour."
[The Beautiful Cure, p. 89]

TNF is the most abundant cytokine within the cells and fluid in the joints
of people with rheumatoid artheritis. [The Beautiful Cure, p. 89]

> "In late 1985, the company Genentech had isolated the gene for TNF and 
obtained significant quantities of the protein by expressing the gene 
in bacteria." [The Beautiful Cure, p. 92]

> "When TNF was blocked, other cytokines stopped being produced by 
the cells. ... This implied that TNF was at the top of a cascade of
events, or the hub of a network, which led to the other inflammatory 
cytokines being produced." [The Beautiful Cure, p. 95]

> "That's not to say blocking TNF is a perfect medicine; far from it. 
There are at least three significant problems with anti-TNF therapy. 
First, blocking this part of the immune system inevitably weakens our
defence against infections. Major problems are rare, but for people with
latent tuberculosis---showing no signs of illness because their immune
system normally controls the infection---there is an increased risk of 
disease reactivating when their immune system is compromised by an 
anti-TNF medicine." [The Beautiful Cure, p. 101]

> "TNF-alpha should have a simpler name, just another numbered interleukin,
IL-something, but just like interferon, it was discovered and named before
the interleukin classification was in place and its cumbersome name stuck."
[The Beautiful Cure, p. 222]

## Antibodies

An "anti-cytokine" [The Beautiful Cure, p. 89]

> "Antibodies are secreted by the white blood cells known as B cells and
are our bodies 'magic bullets', a term coined in the 1890s by German Nobel
laureate Paul Ehrlich. They are soluble protein molecules that stick to and
neutralize all kinds of germs and other potentially dangerous molecules.
Each individual B cell produces and antibody with a uniquely shaped tip, 
the part of the antibody that sticks to its target molecule, called an antigen, 
which might be, for example, something on the outer coat of a bacteria or virus.
However, antibiodies are not designed to bind to germs per se. The shape of 
each antibody's tip is created almost randomly by a process fo chopping
up and rearranging the genes that create the antibody, a remarkable process
in its own right. B cells which happen to have man an antibody that could stick
to healthy cells and tissues are killed off (or inactivated) so that only 
B cells are allowed in the bloodstream are the ones that make antibodies
that stick to something not normally found in the body." [The Beautiful Cure, 
pp. 89--90]

> "This type of antibody is called a *monoclonal* antibody as it derives
from a single B cell. The process can be used to create a protein shaped
to lock onto any molecule of our choosing. As well as being used as 
medicines, antibodies are used in all kinds of scientific experiments, 
to mark out particular cells, block the activity of something or switch
on the activity of something else, check the level at which something 
is being secreted, and so on. 'No single class of reagants stirs our
creativity, or propels our goals, our successes, even our dreams, with 
as much excitement as do monoclonal antibodies,' as one expert has said."
[The Beautiful Cure, p. 93]

> "Antibodies [are] the most precise biological agents we know. A natural
part of our immune system, antibodies circulate in our blood and their job
is to lock onto germs or infected cells and either incapacitate them 
directly or tag them for destruction. Antibodies can be produced to lock 
onto almost anything." [The Beautiful Cure, p. 175]

> "Antibodies are Y-shpaed protein molecules which, as part of oiur natural 
immune defence, lock onto germs or diseased cells. The double-pronged
end of the 'Y' sticks onto a germ or diseased cell, while the back end is 
left exposed. Immune cells have receptors that fit the back end of an 
antibody and when this happens, the immune cell is triggered to kill or 
engulf whatever it is that the front end is tethered to." [The Beautiful 
Cure, p. 189]

## B cells

> "Every B cell also has a version of its own antibody tethered to its surface
(the B cell receptor ...), so that the cell can tell when there is something in 
the body that its antibody could lock onto. When a B cell does have the right 
antibody to lock onto something alien and troublesome, the B cell multiplies
so that its useful antibody is produced in bulk, ready to neutralize the 
intruding molecule or germ. With around 10 billion B cells in the average
person's immune system, each of us has the ability to make around 10 billion
differently shaped antibodies, each of which is able to recognise something
that hasn't been in the body before, ensuring that antibodies can be produced
against virtually any structure alien to the body." [The Beautiful Cure, p. 90]

> "Any animal could make antibodies against a protein found in any other 
animal." [The Beautiful Cure, p. 90] 

## Natural killer cells

> "Heat can induce some types of cancer cells to exhibit at their surface
'stress-inducible proteins', so-called because cells displat these proteins
when they are in a state of stress. Not stressed in the everyday sense of 
the word but cells undergo what is called a stress response when they are 
damaged by, for example, exposure to high temperature, toxins or UV light. 
Protein molecules become misshaped by heat while UV light can break up a 
cell's genetic material, and if a cell has these problems it will put up 
its surface protein molecules which are not found on health cells. These
proteins act as a hallmark of cells that are damaged and when Natural Killer
cells detect them on a cell, they attack it." [The Beautiful Cure, p. 110]

## Regulatory T cells

> "By the time human suppressor T cells were widely accepted to exist, the 
name 'suppressor T cell' had already been used as a synonym for bad science
for over a decade. It had to be changes; a new name for a fresh start. From
here on, these cells were to be called regulatory T cells, or Tregs
(said as T-regs ...)." [The Beautiful Cure, p. 159]

> "The naive T cells, those that had never been switched on before, would in 
the absence of suppressor T cells switch on and attack the mouse' healthy
tissue, so that they developed an autoimmune inflammation in their gut. ...
This fitted precisely with the idea that those T cells responsible for 
fighting germs [naive T cells] were also capable of attacking the body, 
causing autoimmune disease, but that other T cells---the suppressor
T cells---could prevent this."
[The Beautiful Cure, p. 157]

> "T cells [have] particularly high levels of a particular cytokine 
receptor protein at their surface." [The Beautiful Cure, p. 157] 

> "In 2003, three research teams ... discovered that the activity of the
Fox3p gene is not only linked to regulatory T cells, it is essential for
their development and functioning. In fact, the activity of this one
gene has the power to change a normal T cell into a regulatory T cell, 
transforming a cell's purpose from boosting to dampening and immune 
response. This in itself was a dramatic discovery: that a single gene, 
switched on or off, can change a cell's core nature. The reason that this
one gene, Foxp3, is so powerful was found to be that it encodes for a 
protein that directly controls the activity of around 700 other genes. 
It is a hub in the network, a master control gene." [The Beautiful Cure, p. 161]

> "Foxp3 was a far more reliable marker of [regulatory T cells] than 
anything used previously, and this allowed regulatory T cells to be
tracked, isolated, and systematically studied. The research that followed
revealed that regulatory T cells safeguard against unwanted immune
responses in more that one way. They secrete cytokines that dampen
immune responses locally, and they can switch off the activity of another
immune cell with a touch." [The Beautiful Cure, p. 161]
